# Custom Enumerable Project

This repository complements the [Custom Enumerables Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-custom-enumerables) in the Ruby Course for The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to reimplement common methods used frequently through the enumerables module with objects like arrays and hashes. 


### Methods

The following table has the methods you will need to implement along with their associated specs, as outlined in the project instructions. The methods in the Enumerable module only need to work with Arrays, but you can challenge yourself and try to make them work for Hashes as well.

| Method                          | Spec File                       | Notes                                                                 |

| `Enumerable#my_none?`           | spec/my_none_spec.rb            |                                                                       |
| `Enumerable#my_count`           | spec/my_count_spec.rb           |                                                                       |
| `Enumerable#my_map`             | spec/my_map_spec.rb             |                                                                       |
